            <h3>Millets</h3>
            <p>Millets are a group of small-seeded grains that belong to the Poaceae family, commonly grown in arid and
                semi-arid regions. Varieties include pearl millet, finger millet, foxtail millet, and barnyard millet.
                They are known for their high nutritional value, being rich in fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals.
                Millets are gluten-free and have a low glycemic index, making them a healthy choice for those with
                dietary restrictions or diabetes. They can be cooked as a grain, used in porridge, or ground into flour
                for various recipes. Millets are also environmentally sustainable, requiring less water and resources
                compared to other staple crops.</p>
